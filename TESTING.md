The purpose of this document is to summarise the process, results, bugs and fixes as part of manual and automated testing of the coffee-shop website. 
# Automated Testing
All test have been performed using the live envioronment deployed from heroku. 
Automated Unit Testing was done using Djangoâ€™s testing tools by importing the built in TestCase class from Django. Tests are maintained within separate files in each app.
I test the majority of code i have written, while excluding code that derives from Django or other packages (specifically django-allauth) utilised in this app. Additionally, I do not test the webhook files utilising Stripe webhooks, but test similar code i have written as faking the webhooks seems to necessitate utilising the Stripe dashboard manually.
Below is an overview report for testing forms, views and models for each app. The reports are generated when I installed coverage in the terminal using the commands:
- pip3 install covreage
- coverage run --source=(appname) manage.py test
#### To view the reports in the browser:
- coverage report
- coverage html
- python3 -m http.server

### Validation 
* HTML has been validated with link.
* CSS has been validated with link.
* Links checked with W3C Link Checker.
* Each javascript file was tested on the site for errors and functionality using the console and with JSHint.
* Python has been validated using the link.
Most of the problems found were based on lines being too long. I fixed all issues by moving the code around, using the right indentation, curly brackets and testing the site to make sure everything still worked. The only outstanding linting errors I didn't fix are:
* Migrations, aswell as some lines of code in settings.py that were generated with installing django. 
#### W3C Css validation 
I used W3C jigsaw validator to check the 3 CSS files used for this project. Results below show that there are no erros.
* Base
![Base app css validation](documentation/stylecss.png)
* Checkout
![Checkout app css validation](documentation/checkoutcss.png)
* Profile
![Profile app css validation](documentation/profilecss.png)

#### JS Hint Javascript validator
I used JS Hint to check the Javascript files in this project. The following files were checked with no errors founds:
* Checkout app - stripe.element.js
* Profiles app - countryfield.json
* Products app - Fixtures > categories.js and products.json
#### Scripts 
Scripts that have been added within a HTML file. I have decide to add the scripts within the html files due to their small content, It would otherwise be best practice to keep everything seperated in their own file.
* Bag app - bag.html
* Products app - product.html 
* Products app - inlcudes > quantity-script.html

#### Pep8 online validator
I used the PEP8 online validator to check all python files. Most files had (line to long) errors. The error wer fixed and then all files were passed through the validator agian and then no error were found.
When refactoring my code i also used the following command to identify and fix as much pylint error as possible.
* python3 -m flake8

### Bugs 

> 1. The quantity decrement in shopping cart on desktop should stop at zero but users would be able to keep reducing the quantity into minus numbers. If the user updated the quantity with a minus figure the item would just be removed from the cart.

#### Fix: 
With the help of Code Institute, slack and tutor, i changed the Id on the quantity form to a class and refactored the Javascript to look for elements with the same class name. 

> 2. I had a bug when a user had made a purchase the shooping bag should have been cleard from items. Orders went through but after payment confirmation the item would still be in the shopping bag.

#### Fix:
With the help of tutor support i had an indentaion error causing the function to not be executed. I had indented the following line one step to much. Which ment i hade the lines in a if statemnt and not outside it.
This was in the chekout_success view. 
![Line of code](documentation/bugtwo.png)

> 3. When deplying the site i got an "SERVER ERROR". 

#### Fix: 
With the help of tutor support i deleted the session id in Google Developer Tools and that seemd to fix the issue.
