# Automated Testing
Automated Unit Testing was done using Djangoâ€™s testing tools by importing the built in TestCase class from Django. Below is an overview report for testing forms, views and models for each app. The reports are generated when I installed coverage in the terminal using the commands:
- pip3 install covreage
- coverage run --source=(appname) manage.py test
#### To view the reports in the browser:
- coverage report
- coverage html
- python3 -m http.server
