Coffee shop is a small family run coffee shop serving fresh coffee to people in London.
I have created this full-stack application using the Python, Django framework, Heroku PostgreSQL and front-end technologies, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

My website can be found here ....

## Goals 
The goal for this project was to allow users to register and confirm their email address, create a profile that would store user order information, order history, and favourited products.

Users also can browse filter and sort products by name and category.

As well as allow purchases of products themed around coffee, making reviews for products, aswell as contacting the store admin via mail. 
Visitors to the site may also subscribe to a newsletter. And receive an confirmation email after purchsing. 

The projects purpose is to enable customers to make purchases, register for an account, and review products while enjoying a nice user experience and user interface.
