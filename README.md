# Coffee Shop 
![IMG ALT DESC HERE](IMG PATH HERE)

Coffee shop is a small family run coffee shop serving fresh coffee to people in London.
I have created this full-stack application using the Python, Django framework, Heroku PostgreSQL and front-end technologies, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

My website can be found here ....

## Goals 
The goal for this project was to allow users to register and confirm their email address, create a profile that would store user order information, order history, and favourited products.

Users also can browse filter and sort products by name and category.

As well as allow purchases of products themed around coffee, making reviews for products, aswell as contacting the store admin via mail. 
Visitors to the site may also subscribe to a newsletter. And receive an confirmation email after purchsing. 

The projects purpose is to enable customers to make purchases, register for an account, and review products while enjoying a nice user experience and user interface.

## User Experience

User experience has been designed with a minimalistic, clean, and professional look. A light-colored background and bold dark colors for text as well as sharp images portray the purpose and goal of the e-commerce-site.
The visitors to Coffee Shop is most likely someone who enjoys making nice coffee at home. Who enjoys a nice espresso, or a pour over coffee from whole beans. A visitor to Coffee shop is also someone who most likely enjoys reading about coffee.

### Web Marketing Startegy 

Building on the insights gained as part of the Design Thinking phase. This project has the business model of Business to customer as the business is selling directly to the end user. 

#### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

SEO is key to driving traffic from a browser search like Google to the website. To help improve the search engine ranking I ensured each web page has it's own title, and the site carries meta tags for a description and keywords which encapsulate the general content and focus of this B2C site.

#### Sitemap.xml / Robots.txt 
I have created a sitemap.xml and robot.txt to help search engines locate my website. And to keep the website safe. 

#### Newsletter 

To allow the business to communicate with their customers to promote products and events through digital marketing, i have created a newsletter (One of three original models). The newsletter can be found at the bottom of the site, in the footer. Once the emial address is submitted a success message is presented to notify that the user is signed up. If by chance the user trys to sign up agian, the user is notifyied that their emial is already signed up.

#### Coffee shop location 

I have used Google Maps within an iframe inside the footer to promote the physical store location to show customers how they can physicaly experience the businesses coffee.


#### Facebook Page 
To increase traffic to the website, a facebook page has been built that will display information about the products and business.
