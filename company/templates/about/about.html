    <p>The name, motivated by Moby Dick, evoked the sentiment of the high oceans and the marine convention of the early espresso brokers.</p>
    <p>In 1981, Howard Schultz (Coffee-shop director, president, and CEO) first strolled into an Coffee-shop store. From his first measure of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Coffee-shop and joined a year later.</p>
    <p>After a year, in 1983, Howard made a trip to Italy and ended up dazzled by Italian coffeehouses and the sentiment of the espresso encounter. He had a dream to take the Italian caf√© custom back to the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>Today, with stores in excess of 75 markets, Coffee-shop is the chief roaster and retailer of forte espresso on the planet. Furthermore, with each container, we endeavor to bring both our legacy and an extraordinary affair to life.</p>
